This is a sample cross-platform, Universal Swift 4 Framework for Xcode 9 that belongs to our three part article on the steps Appracatappra uses to create Universal Framework projects in Swift that will support iOS, tvOS, watchOS and macOS, all while sharing as much common code as possible.

In the first part, [Building Cross-Platform Universal Frameworks using Swift](http://appracatappra.com/2018/03/building-cross-platform-universal-frameworks-using-swift/), we covered the steps to create the **Universal Framework** project, have it support multiple OSes, share as much code as possible across OSes, build the API documentation for each OS version and include both hardware and simulator support for iOS, watchOS and tvOS frameworks.

The second part, [Cross-Platform Universal Swift Framework Installers](http://appracatappra.com/2018/03/cross-platform-universal-swift-framework-installers/), covers creating an **Installer Package** from our compiled **Universal Frameworks** that includes all of the Apple OSes that the framework supports and placing them in the correct locations in the consumer’s development computer.

The third and final part, [Using Your Custom Cross-Platform Universal Swift Framework](http://appracatappra.com/2018/03/using-your-custom-cross-platform-universal-swift-framework/), covers installing and using our custom cross-platform **Universal Swift Framework** on a consumer’s development computer, updating to new framework version and trimming the “fat binary” framework to release the app to the iTunes App Store.
